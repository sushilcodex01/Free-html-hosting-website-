## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues on InfinityFree:

## Customization

$maxFileSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // Change 5 to desired MB
```

### Adding File Types:
Edit `upload.php` line 7:
```php
$allowedExtensions = ['html', 'css', 'js', 'txt', 'new_type'];
```

### Styling Changes:
Modify the CSS variables in each PHP file's `<style>` section:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6c5ce7;    /* Main color */
    --secondary-color: #a29bfe;  /* Secondary color */
